    "Question 1: What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational database in short. In which scenarious it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL database.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "MongoDB- MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also alows you to work with that data very efficiently. it is \n",
    "categorized under the NoSQL(Not only SQL) database because the storage and retrieval of data in the MongoDB are not in the form of tables.\n",
    "The MongoDB is developed and managed by MongoDB.Inc under SSPL(Server Side Public License) and initially released in February 2009. it also provides official driver support for\n",
    "all the popular languages like C, C++, C#, and.Net, Go ,Java, Node.js, Perl, PHP,Python.\n",
    "so, that you can create an application using any of these languages. nowdays there are so many companies that used MongoDB like facebook, Nokia, eBay, Adobe, google, etc. to \n",
    "store thier large amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational database-\n",
    "Non-relational database(often called NoSQL database) are different from traditional relational database in that they store thier data in a non-tabular form. Instead, non-relational\n",
    "database might be based on data structures like documents. A document can be highly detalied while contaning a range of different types of information in different formats. This \n",
    "ability to digest and organize various types of information side by side makes non-relational database much more flexible than relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In which scenarious it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL database?-\n",
    "In comparison to the SQL server, MongoDB is faster and more scalable. while the SQL server supports JOIN and Global transactions, MongoDB does not. The MS SQL server does not \n",

    "Question 2: State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "These are some important features of MongoDB:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Support ad hoc queries\n",
    "In MongoDB, you can search by search by field, range query and it also supports regural expression searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Indexing\n",
    "You can index any field in document.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Replication\n",
    "MongoDB supports Master Slave replication.\n",
    "A master can perfome Reads and Writesand a slave copies data from the master and can only be used for reads or back up(not writes)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. duplication of data\n",
    "MongoDB can run over multiple servers. The data is duplicated to keep the system up and also keep its running condition in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Load balancing\n",
    "it has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Schema-less Database: it is the great feature provided by the the MongoDB. A Schema-less database means one collection can hold different types of documents in it. Or in other \n",
    "words, in the MongoDB database, a single collection can hold multiple documents and these documents may consist of the different of fields, content,and size. it is not necessary\n",
    "that the one document is similar to another document like the relational database. Due to this coolfeature, MongoDB provides great flexibility to database.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Document Oriented: In MongoDB, all the data stored in the documents instead of tables like in RDBMS. in these documents, the data is stored in fields(key-value pair) instead of \n",
    "rows and columns which make the data much more flexible in comparison to RDBMS. And each document contains its unique object id.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of sharding.sharding means to distribute data on multiple servers, here a large amount of data is partitioned\n",
    "into data chunks using the shard key, and these data chunks are evenly distributed across shards that reside across many physical servers. it will also add new machines to a \n",
    "running database.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Aggreation: it allows to perfom operations on the grouped data and get a single result or computed result. it is similar to the SQL GROUPBY clause. it provides three\n",
    "three aggreations."
